This code uses a non-standard way of checking for null values and can lead to unexpected behavior.  The `empty()` function in PHP considers `0`, `0.0`, `"0"`, `false`, `[]`, and `null` as empty. If the variable `$result` contains `0` or `0.0` which may be valid results, this code will treat them as errors.  This is particularly problematic since a null value may be considered a successful result in some cases.
