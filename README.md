This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in PHP related to the `empty()` function's behavior with numeric values and its unexpected interaction when checking database results for null values. The original code incorrectly identifies valid numeric results (0, 0.0) as errors. The solution offers a more robust approach to check for null values, ensuring accurate handling of all potential outcomes.
